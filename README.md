# PiMat Timer
A full featured Rubik's cube timer made to run on a raspberry pi with a 3.5 inch touch screen. Inspiration taken from the stackmat timer for the
hardware and from csTimer for the software.

#Hardware
This timer is made to integrate with a 3d printed case I designed. The case integrates the 3.5 inch touch screen, a 10000mah battery and two buttons to start the timer stackmat style. The buttons connect to GPIO19 and GPIO26 (physical pins 35 and 37).
