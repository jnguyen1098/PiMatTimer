# PiMat Timer
A full featured Rubik's cube timer made to run on a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS. Inspiration taken from the stackmat timer for the
hardware and from csTimer for the software.

# Hardware
This timer is made to integrate with a 3d printed case I designed. The case integrates a 3.5 inch touch screen, a 10000mah battery and two buttons to start the timer stackmat style. The buttons connect to GPIO19 and GPIO26 (physical pins 35 and 37).

More information about the hardware will come soon.

# Installation
When cloning this repo to your pi make sure to also clone the submodules
```
git clone git@github.com:mrusse/PiMatTimer --recurse-submodules
```

Then install the requirments
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You could now run the program by doing ```python3 timer.py``` however you should setup the program to run at startup if you are using the pi as a dedicated timer.

You can use autostart to do this on the pi
```
mkdir /home/pi/.config/autostart
nano /home/pi/.config/autostart/timer.desktop
```
Then put this in the ```timer.desktop``` file.
```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Timer
Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/PiMatTimer/timer.py
```
Save and exit with ```ctrl + x```, followed by ```y``` when prompted to save, and then ```enter```. Reboot with:
```
sudo reboot
```
The program should now launch on start up

# Features

The timer can provide scrambles for 2x2 - 7x7 and also has a scramble image tool for 3x3. The main screen will also display you current average of 5 and 12 similar to csTimer

Every scramble the timer uses is generated using the pyTwistScrambler module which can generate WCA random state scrambles.
However to reduce lag there is a buffer file of scrambles that is used. Each time you do a solve it pulls a scramble from the 
buffer file, deletes that scramble, then in a new thread adds a new scramble generated by pyTwistyScrambler to the end of the file.
It is done this way since there is a delay in generating these random state scrambles on the pi (about 3 seconds). So using this file
buffer method makes the experience seamless.

###### Solves list screen which lists all your solves in the current session

You can select a time and click ```Delete Selected Time``` to remove that solve. Each session (2x2 - 7x7) will store their times seperatly.

**Settings menu**

In the settings you can change your puzzle type and turn on or off WCA inspection. You also have access to some system controls here such as the option to shutdown the pi or exit the program.

If the pi has a wifi connection it will also show the link to a local webserver where you can export your solves or download a current screenshot of the program. (View image below)
